# FIFA - MoneyBall Project

This project arises as a challenge proposed by the professors of the IronHack Data Analysis Bootcamp, in which with a given dataset with all the statistics of all the players of the FIFA game, the idea is to carry out a statistical examination and draw conclusions from it. .
